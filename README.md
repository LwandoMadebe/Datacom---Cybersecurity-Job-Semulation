# Datacom---Cybersecurity-Job-Simulation

### Task 1: APT breach: analysing the impact on information security
1. Investigate a cyber attack and produce a comprehensive report documenting your findings and outline key recommendations for improving a client's cybersecurity posture

In this task, I took on the role of a cybersecurity consultant for Datacom, investigating a cyberattack on a client by the APT34 group, a government-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat. My mission was to research APT34’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), assess the extent of the breach, and determine its impact on the client’s information security. I produced a comprehensive report detailing my findings and recommendations to strengthen the client's cybersecurity posture, focusing on the importance of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in protecting against future threats.

#### Comprehensive report 
##### What is their history?

Advanced persistent threat (APT) 34 or APT34, which can be also known as OilRig. This group has been noted since 2014 and some people believe that they are associated with the Iranian Government for performing these numerous acts against other global sectors such as telecommunications and energy, especially in the Middle East. 

#### Which nation/state are they associated with?

APT34 is associated with the Iranian Government, which is linked with their intelligence. This group is used by the nation to serve their interest, especially gathering sensitive information. 

#### Do they target specific industries?

APT34 target many industries, especially telecommunications, financial, energy, government, and chemical industries. The reason why they target these industries is because they want sectors that align with Iran's strategic and economic interests. 

#### What are their motives?

Their main focus is espionage which means the practice of spying on industries that are aligned with Iranian interests and they do that by gathering sensitive information to serve the Iranian national interests. This usually includes disruption of infrastructure, intellectual properties, etc. 

#### What are the TTPs they use to conduct their attacks?

APT uses various tactics to perform these attacks such as 

1. They use phishing attacks which means pretending to be someone else to trick the victim by clicking that malicious link. 
They use Malware tools such as DNSpionage and TONEDEAF to steal important information or to gain access to the victim's system. 

#### What security measures could the client implement to defend against cyberattacks conducted by this APT?

There are many robust measures the client could implement such as:

1. Training employees about Phishing and Social Engineering and to be vigilant, not click or download anything suspicious.  
2. Use email filtering to detect and block links and attachments that are malicious
3. Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion-preventing systems (IPS) to detect and block attempted intrusion.
4. Regularly upgrade and update systems to protect against known weaknesses 
5. It is important always to monitor the network traffic, which will help detect suspicious activity in the network. 

Additionally, the client must invest in training their cyber security professionals because they are the backbone of security and they must be aware of the latest cyber news and how they can detect vulnerabilities.  

### Task 2: Cybersecurity risk assessment
1. Complete a risk assessment for a client and help them define the context, assess their risk matrix, and identify potential risk scenarios

The next task was to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for the client. Although the client had physical security measures like a fence and a padlock, they were concerned about risks to their information and systems. My role was to identify, evaluate, and prioritize potential threats and vulnerabilities in their network and systems. 

I identified key assets that needed protection, created a risk matrix, and evaluated potential risk scenarios. I assessed the risk ratings for each scenario, considering the existing security measures. Afterward, I produced a risk assessment report summarizing my findings and recommending steps to mitigate risks and improve the client’s security posture.

The goal was to help the client prioritize and implement security measures that ensured the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information, while also protecting their reputation and resources. My work also helped them comply with regulatory standards and provided peace of mind by demonstrating expert cybersecurity management.

In this task, I was responsible for documenting the client's risk position using the padlock analogy as an example. The client wanted me to help them define the context of their security situation, assess their risk matrix, and identify potential risk scenarios. This involved examining how the padlock, representing the existing security measures, could be bypassed and highlighting any vulnerabilities in their overall security posture. I evaluated potential risks, considering both the physical and digital aspects, and provided recommendations for strengthening their security based on the findings.
